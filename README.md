Time-Series-Forecasting-Basic-version
=====================================

A Matlab code repository describing the basic model applied towards time series forecasting. The standard process of 
approximation is showed in this repository. A basic approximation model consists of many delayed inputs which are
fed to function which is able to predict the current input. When trained over many samples of original information, the 
system is able to understand the idea in which the data might be varying. Using that we can predict future data.
